# YOUR-S-H-S
    Welcome to YOUR-S-H-S, a second hand store REST API project created with PHP and MySQL. This project includes various endpoints for managing garments and sellers, which can be tested using Postman.

#  Installation
    To use this project, clone this repository from GitHub and create a database named 'YOURSHS' by running the included SQL script on your workbench or phpMyAdmin page. You will also need to create a config.php file in the partials folder and enter your host, database name, user and password.

#  Testing Endpoints with Postman
    Postman is a popular tool for testing APIs. To test the endpoints in this project, follow these steps:

    - Open Postman and import the following endpoints:

       * A list of all garments in the database
       * A specific garment with id
       * Add a new garment to the database
       * Update an existing garment
       *  Get a list of all sellers alphabetically
       *  Get a specific seller with id
       * Add a new seller to the database
       * Get all garments submitted by the seller
       * Total sales amount and number of garments sold by a specific seller
       *  Number of garments submitted by a specific seller
       * For each endpoint, send the appropriate request and check the response  to ensure the endpoint is working correctly.
